    <h1>On Aberrator</h1>
    <h2>An introduction by Awn</h2>
    <p>Have you been subjected to an icebreaker recently? As a doctoral
      student who did not take take a break after their undergraduate
      program, these have been imposed on me for many years. Typically
      the format involves the sharing of some superficial traits such as
      the names, fields of study, and preferred pronouns of the
      unwitting participants. Sometimes other information is requested.
      This can range from practical (e.g. “where are you from?”, “what
      year in the program are you?”) to frivolous (e.g. “what is your
      favorite ice cream flavor?”). Occasionally an attempt is made to
      encourage the memorization of names, for example by repeating all
      the names and factoids of earlier participants, or to encourage
      further conversation among participants who share some traits.</p>
    <p>When one is suggested, I often jest of the need for an ice pick
      instead. I don’t find icebreakers to be particularly helpful.
      Although I might remember some of the traits and the faces, I tend
      not to remember names. Taking in all the information at once only
      makes it harder. Also, asking for pronouns is just so gauche. I
      have been told that asking everyone to declare some pronouns makes
      for a more comfortable environment for those whose pronouns might
      not conform to traditional expectations and reduces the likelihood
      of misgendering someone. However, it seems that the process is
      more likely to simply isolate and identify those without
      traditional pronouns, unless there are many of them. Furthermore,
      I find it somewhat invasive to essentially demand to know
      someone’s gender. What if they don’t know or don’t want to share?
      Perhaps one day expectations of gender expression can be divorced
      from gender identity and this will cease to be an issue.</p>
    <p>Anyway, I have always felt the need for a better icebreaker. A
      friend of mine likes to ask: What color are you feeling today?
      While I am amicable to the quaint sentiment of this question, it
      often leaves one without any real information, which is not ideal
      for an icebreaker. So I am partial to my own icebreaker question:
      What is your epithet?</p>
    <p>For those unfamiliar with epithets, these are brief descriptors
      which typically follow a name, providing further information about
      that entity. While epithets are found aplenty among gods and kings
      of all types, I find the purest forms are those of the Roman cult
      deities. Here is a brief table with some examples:</p>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Deity Name</td>
          <td>Epithet</td>
          <td>Translation</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Jupiter</td>
          <td>Optimus Maximus</td>
          <td>the best and the greatest</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Juno</td>
          <td>Moneta</td>
          <td>the warner</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Mars</td>
          <td>Ultor</td>
          <td>the avenger</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Sol</td>
          <td>Invictus</td>
          <td>the unconquered</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Joshua</td>
          <td>Cristo</td>
          <td>the anointed</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Clever readers might have noticed that Jupiter already contains
      an epithet within, essentially reading as “Zeus, our Father, the
      best and the greatest”, so this god has three epithets in one!
      Indeed, these deities had many epithets and were made malleable in
      part by the invocation of different epithets in different
      situations. I have slipped in the last one to emphasize the
      flexibility of this form. Although some might object that he was
      not Roman, his cult and deification certainly were. That is
      reflected in the use of epithets as it is with other facets of
      that tradition.</p>
    <p>I would also note the epithets in my tradition. Consider the
      formula for any blessing, which reads, literally: “my master, our
      god, king of the world.” So three epithets. Or the thirteen
      attributes of mercy which would read as a list of epithets to
      anyone in the ancient Mediterranean world. In fact, people in the
      polytheistic world of those times would have seen the many
      epithets attributed to the monotheistic god as a symbol of
      supremacy over human kings and false idols alike.</p>
    <p>The malleability of epithets is what makes a declaration of
      epithets so useful for an icebreaker. The epithet can vary as
      needed. It can be sincere to provoke conversation or comical as a
      means of deflection. If you are feeling cheeky, just introduce
      yourself as Optimus Maximus. After all, we were created in the
      image of god, so why not?</p>
    <p>In my table, I have tried to pick what I feel is the most
      fundamental epithet, the most essential one, the one which is most
      strongly associated with the character. I think that is an
      important thing to understand. So as a means of introduction, I
      would like to inform you that my epithet is: Aberrator.</p>
    <p>To aberrate is to wander, so an aberrator is a wanderer. The word
      has Latin roots ab, meaning ‘from’ or ‘away from’, and erro,
      meaning ‘stray’. It is often pejorative, having the same root as
      the word ‘error’. I first encountered the word ‘aberration’ when
      studying electron microscopy as an undergraduate. This use of the
      word as a technical term, to refer to distortions in an optical
      system, is very much pejorative. Aberrations are important to me
      as I have chosen to research in the field of electron microscopy
      as a graduate student. Those who require eyeglasses may be
      familiar with aberrations in the technical sense as well. For
      those who are not, I will try to provide a brief introduction.</p>
    <p>Aberrations can be described in order of increasing complexity.
      The most basic aberration is defocus, which manifests as an
      anisotropic blurring of the image. Anyone who has used a camera is
      likely familiar with this effect. In the case that you somehow
      have not, defocus may be simulated by placing an object close to
      your eyes, looking at that object to focus on it, and observing
      some objects more distant. If your focus is maintained on the
      nearby object, the distant objects should appear blurred as these
      are beyond the depth of focus of human eyes. An ideal object with
      which to observe this phenomenon is a large piece of paper with
      text or fabric with a pattern throughout, where the blurring
      effect on distant text or motifs would be readily apparent when
      focusing on nearby details. The next is two-fold astigmatism,
      which manifests as a directional blurring. This can be simulated
      by squinting when looking at a bright light in the dark. One
      interesting component of two-fold astigmatism is that the
      direction of blurring is orthogonal at depths on either side of
      the focal point. Some higher order aberrations include three-fold
      astigmatism, coma, and spherical aberration. These are more
      difficult to simulate or observe offhand, though all tend to blur
      the image in various ways. Then there is chromatic aberration,
      where different wavelengths or colors in the illuminating beam are
      focused to different depths. Aberrations more complicated than
      these are typically described only mathematically and not named.</p>
    <p>As should be clear from this description, aberrations are
      detrimental to traditional microscopes. In these optical systems,
      lenses or other optical elements magnify the illuminating beam to
      directly produce an image of the object. Aberrations result in the
      aforementioned artifacts in those images. However, aberrations may
      be advantageous or necessary for scanning diffraction microscopy.
      In this alternative mode, the illuminating beam is focused to a
      fine point and rastered about the object to collect diffraction
      patterns at each point. Then an image of the object is
      reconstructed from this data. The most basic way to produce an
      image is to use the sum of certain pixels in the diffraction
      patterns as the intensity of an image formed by all the scan
      positions. Aberrations are still detrimental to such simple
      images. However, it is possible to consider the images produced in
      this manner as images of the same object observed along different
      lines of sight. Therefore, it is possible to use the parallax
      effect, where the relative position of object features shifts to
      an increased degree with depth along the line of sight, to align
      the simple images and produce an enhanced image. A moderate amount
      of defocus is necessary for this algorithm to succeed and small
      amounts of other aberrations may be acceptable. A small amount of
      defocus is also beneficial for another ptychography. In this
      algorithm, diffraction patterns are simulated by guessing the
      illuminating beam shape and object features. The simulated
      diffraction patterns are compared to experimental ones to improve
      the guess for the illuminating beam and the object until the
      simulated diffraction patterns match the experimental patterns. It
      has been shown by calculation and experiment that small amounts of
      defocus allow for a successful reconstruction with increased scan
      step size, which is desirable to reduce the extent to which the
      object must be subjected to the beam. This is essential for
      sensitive objects that may be particularly susceptible to
      destruction by the illuminating beam. My personal speculation is
      that other aberrations will improve the imaging capability of
      ptychography in different ways which have yet to be demonstrated.
      One other feature of ptychography is that some depth information
      may be determined by simulating the propagation of the
      illuminating beam through a three-dimensional object. I suspect it
      is possible to deliberately introduce some small two-fold
      astigmatism to the illuminating beam in order to enhance the
      resolution of this depth information. As the intensity of
      astigmatism will increase with distance from the focal point and
      the direction of astigmatism will be orthogonal on either side of
      the focal point, this information could be incorporated into the
      reconstruction algorithm for increased depth resolution. Perhaps
      the higher order aberrations, utilized in moderation, may provide
      yet more information, of which I have not speculated.</p>
    <p>As a doctoral student, I have been accused of wandering, perhaps
      of aberrating and certainly in a pejorative sense, in the course
      of my research. In fact, I suspect that this is the true reason
      for my recent departure from my former research group. I was too
      willing to try new or different things, to experiment with foreign
      methods, to stray from the imagined path. So why would I take this
      as my epithet? Well, I find this accusation absurd! What is the
      point of research if everything goes to plan? How can anything new
      be learned if one must follow an established path? If ptychography
      had only been attempted with perfect beams, the benefits of
      aberrations may never have been discovered. So, despite the
      potential adversity, I will keep wandering in my research.</p>
    <p>Besides my professional life, I feel that I have been doing some
      physical wandering. It seems to me that, one way or another, I do
      not stay in one place for so long. Yet, despite my wandering, I do
      not go far. I was born in the San Francisco Bay Area but was moved
      to Orange County for elementary school. I stayed there only until
      the fourth grade, when I returned to the north. Then I changed
      locations within Northern California when I changed school systems
      after the seventh grade and, of course, when going to college.
      However, I soon returned home for the duration of the pandemic
      before going back to Los Angeles for graduate school. After just
      two years of that, I was back in the Bay again for research, then
      back to LA for the same. Of course, the moment I returned to LA,
      we had those terrible fires in the Pacific Palisades and Altadena.
      So I left and came back yet again. Since then I have been going
      back and forth from north to south for research purposes as my
      experiments require particular equipment. So overall, I have not
      stayed in one place for more than five years. The time between my
      general movements has steadily decreased to perhaps two. Moreover,
      my wandering has become ever more intense in recent months.</p>
    <p>Perhaps I am cursed, with the first curse, to wander? Have I
      acquired a new mark of Cain? Then I remember that ‘my father was a
      wandering [lit: lost] Aramean’ and I think of my ancestors. My
      father’s family is from Galacia, in eastern Europe, and in the
      course of two generations they came to New York and spread across
      the United States with my grandfather ending up in California. It
      is much the same with my mother’s family who went from Punjab to
      Tanzania to New York and finally to California, also in two
      generations. Of course my more distant ancestors surely had their
      own paths to Punjab and Galacia from Eretz Israel. Still, was all
      of that wandering? I am not so sure. It is not quite wandering to
      flee from one place to another, as my ancestors were largely
      doing. Certainly there is a difference also between traveling or
      visiting and wandering. In my movements, I have gone from one
      place to another, hoping to stay but choosing to move yet again.
      Most of all, I have gone back and forth, which feels more like
      wandering than fleeing or escaping.</p>
    <p>In all my wandering, I have often felt like an outsider or guest.
      I certainly have a lot of experience establishing myself and
      making new friends in a new place. It is a far cry from the modern
      American idyll of a small yet stalwart hometown, from which one
      might emerge only upon their enrollment in a college or
      university. Or from life in an ancient village, which residents
      may never leave. Perhaps this is the new normal, especially for
      young people such as myself in a world perhaps more mobile and
      less stable than ever. My family is well practiced in playing the
      part of the wandering Jew. For that matter it is fortunate that I
      am Jewish for I know that I will always have a home, a place to
      belong, among fellow Jews, wherever I go. This phenomenon of
      wandering has been a core feature of the Jewish experience over
      the years and I have found it in my life as well. I can only hope
      that given recent events, I will not be forced to become a
      wandering Jew like those of times past.</p>
    <p>So what is your epithet? You can see now why I consider myself
      Aberrator. Maybe is true that not all those who wander . . .</p>
