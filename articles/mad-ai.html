    <h1>MAD AI</h1>
    <h2>by Awn</h2>
    <p>There is a concept from the atomic era known as mutually assured
      destruction, rightfully abbreviated as MAD. It is the idea that
      two nuclear powers must never use their weapons against each other
      for fear of retaliation, yet must ever expand their arsenals to
      guarantee second strike capability. It is an insane extension of
      the old competition for state security that is finally beginning
      to break down.<br>
    </p>
    <p>With this framework, I argued in favor of artificial intelligence
      (AI) back in 2017, when I was still in high school. Like today, AI
      was an exciting and controversial technology. Unlike today, AI was
      a distant phenomenon. Occasionally there was some news or a report
      but the general public had little or no access. Still, everyone
      was sure of the immense economic and destructive potential of AI,
      which to me seemed similar to that of atomic energy. You must
      forgive me for I knew even at the time that it was a simple and
      extreme argument. However, I had a half page limit and knew what
      would fit. Here is what I wrote:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="center">We Can't Afford To Not Research AI
      </p>
      <p>The question of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is similar to that
        of human genetic modification, which I have already addressed in
        this class. The answer is therefore essentially the same. Just as
        I argued that human genetic modification must be pursued because
        the alternative is for someone else to develop it first, so I
        would argue for the development of AI. The fact is, given the wide
        dissemination of information, and accessibility of computing
        technology in our modern society, stopping someone from attempting
        to develop AI technology would be extremely difficult if not
        outright impossible. The one thing worse than having murderous AI
        is someone else having murderous AI while you do not. The need to
        develop a technology before one's rivals affects even the most
        anti-AI tech giants such as Elon Musk, who despite AI misgivings
        nevertheless has created a company to research AI.
      </p>
      <p>Opponents of AI might argue that preventing AI development is an
        issue humanity can't afford to compromise on. A single failure
        could result in annihilation by a superintelligent hostile AI
        entity without any possible retaliation regardless of whether that
        AI was created deliberately or not. But again, this brings up the
        original point. If someone else is making (and someone else will
        be making) potentially dangerous AI that humans can not outwit,
        then logically those who oppose AI must attempt to make their own
        human-friendly AI to protect themselves from any potential hostile
        AI. Yes, this is playing with fire, but remember: Humans didn't
        become the dominant species in order to safeguard their existence
        without playing with fire, and those ancient human species that
        didn't play with fire are long dead and gone.
      </p>
